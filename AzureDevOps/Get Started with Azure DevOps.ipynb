    "### Calculating Customer Value Artifacts\n",
    "\n",
    "- Total lead time:\n",
    "    - The time for a feature to make it to the customer\n",
    "- Process time:\n",
    "    - The time spent on a feature that has value to the customer\n",
    " - Activity Ratio is the process time divided by the lead time <br>\n",

    "    - Use telemetry to get information about performance and usage patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "## Elite Performing Teams\n",
    "\n",
