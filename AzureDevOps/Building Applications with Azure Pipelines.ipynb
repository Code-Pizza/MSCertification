    "A public GitHub/Azure DevOps repository is accessible to everyone, whereas a private repository is accessible to you and the people you share it with. In both cases, only collaborators can commit changes to a repository. For open source projects typically both the GitHub repository and the Azure DevOps project are set to public. If your project is closed source, you would likely make both your GitHub repository and your Azure DevOps project private.\n",
