    "## Introduction to Data Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "The key to unlocking this data is being able to tell a story with it. In today's highly competitive and fast-paced business world, crafting reports that tell that story is what helps business leaders take action on the data. Business decision makers depend on an accurate story to drive better business decisions. The faster a business can make precise decisions, the more competitive they will be and the better advantage they will have. Without the story, it is difficult to understand what the data is trying to tell you.\n",
    "\n",
    "The underlying challenge that businesses face today is understanding and using their data in such a way that impacts their business and ultimately their bottom line. You need to be able to look at the data and facilitate trusted business decisions. Then, you need the ability to look at metrics and clearly understand the meaning behind those metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your journey of telling a story with data also ties into building that data culture within your organization. While telling the story is important, where that story is told is also crucial, ensuring that the story is told to the right people. Also, make sure that people can discover the story, that they know where to find it, and that it is part of the regular interactions.\n",

    "## Overview of Data Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Data analysis is the process of identifying, cleaning, transforming, and modeling data to discover meaningful and useful information. The data is then crafted into a story through reports for analysis to support the critical decision-making process.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the process of data analysis focuses on the tasks of cleaning, modeling, and visualizing data, the concept of data analysis and its importance to business should not be understated. To analyze data, core components of analytics are divided into the following categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Descriptive Analytics\n",
    "- Descriptive analytics help answer questions about what has happened based on historical data. \n",
    "- Descriptive analytics techniques summarize large datasets to describe outcomes to stakeholders.\n",
    "- By developing key performance indicators (KPIs), these strategies can help track the success or failure of key objectives.\n",
    "### Diagnostic\n",
    "- Diagnostic analytics help answer questions about why events happened. \n",
    "- Diagnostic analytics techniques supplement basic descriptive analytics, and they use the findings from descriptive analytics to discover the cause of these events\n",
    "- Performance indicators are further investigated to discover why these events improved or became worse.\n",
    "    - Identify anomalies in the data. These anomalies might be unexpected changes in a metric or a particular market.\n",
    "    - Collect data that's related to these anomalies.\n",
    "    - Use statistical techniques to discover relationships and trends that explain these anomalies. \n",
    "### Predictive\n",
    "- Predictive analytics help answer questions about what will happen in the future. \n",
    "- Predictive analytics techniques use historical data to identify trends and determine if they're likely to recur. \n",
    "- Predictive analytical tools provide valuable insight into what might happen in the future.\n",
    "- Statistical and machine learning techniques such as neural networks, decision trees, and regression.\n",
    "### Prescriptive\n",
    "- Prescriptive analytics help answer questions about which actions should be taken to achieve a goal or target. \n",
    "- By using insights from predictive analytics, organizations can make informed data-driven decisions in the face of uncertainty. \n",
    "- Prescriptive analytics techniques rely on machine learning strategies to find patterns in large datasets. \n",
    "- By analyzing past decisions and events, organizations can estimate the likelihood of different outcomes.\n",
    "### Cognitive\n",
    "- Cognitive analytics attempt to draw inferences from existing data and patterns, derive conclusions based on existing knowledge bases\n",
    "- Then add the findings back into the knowledge base for future inferences, a self-learning feedback loop. \n",
    "- Cognitive analytics help you learn what might happen if circumstances change and determine how you might handle these situations.\n",
    "- Unstructured hypotheses that are gathered from several sources and expressed with varying degrees of confidence. \n",
    "- Effective cognitive analytics depend on machine learning algorithms and natural language processing concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A retail business uses descriptive analytics to look at patterns of purchases from previous years to determine what products might be popular next year.\n",
    "1. Determine that a certain product was popular over a specific timeframe. Then, they can use this analysis to determine whether certain marketing efforts or online social activities contributed to the sales increase.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Roles in Data Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "### Business Analyst\n",
    "-  A business analyst is closer to the business and is a specialist in interpreting the data that comes from the visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Analyst\n",
    "- A data analyst enables businesses to maximize the value of their data assets through visualization and reporting tools.\n",
    "- Design and build scalable and effective data models, \n",
    "- Enable and implement the advanced analytics capabilities into reports for analysis. \n",
    "- Works with the pertinent stakeholders to identify appropriate and necessary data and reporting requirements\n",
    "- Turn raw data into relevant and meaningful insights.\n",
    "- Responsible for the management of Power BI assets, including reports, dashboards, workspaces, and the underlying datasets that are used in the reports. \n",
    "- Implement and configure proper security procedures, in conjunction with stakeholder requirements, to ensure the safekeeping of all Power BI assets and their data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Engineer\n",
    "- Provision and set up data platform technologies that are on-premises and in the cloud. \n",
    "- Manage and secure the flow of structured and unstructured data from multiple sources.\n",
    "- Ensure that data services securely and seamlessly integrate across data services.\n",
    "- Use of on-premises and cloud data services and tools to ingest, egress, and transform data from multiple sources.\n",
    "- Collaborate with business stakeholders to identify and meet data requirements.\n",
    "- Brings data together, often described as data wrangling, so projects move faster by allowing data scientists to focus on their own areas of work.\n",
    "- Ensures Data Analysts can access the variety of structured and unstructured data sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Scientist\n",
    "- Perform advanced analytics to extract value from data. \n",
    "- Use descriptive analytics to evaluate data through a process known as exploratory data analysis (EDA). \n",
    "- Use predictive analytics in machine learning to apply modeling techniques that can detect anomalies or patterns (important parts of forecast models).\n",
    "- May also use deep learning, performing iterative experiments to solve a complex data problem by using customized algorithms.\n",
    "- A data scientist looks at data to determine the questions that need answers and will often devise a hypothesis or an experiment \n",
    "    - Then collaborate with the data analyst on the data visualization and reporting.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Database Administrator\n",
    "- Implements and manages the operational aspects of cloud-native and hybrid data platform solutions.\n",
    "- Responsible for the overall availability and consistent performance and optimizations of the database solutions.\n",
    "- Work with stakeholders to identify and implement the policies, tools, and processes for data backup and recovery plans.\n",
    "- Monitors and manages the overall health of a database and the hardware that it resides on\n",
    "- Responsible for managing the overall security of the data, granting and restricting user access and privileges to the data as determined by business needs and requirements.\n",
