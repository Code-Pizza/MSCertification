    "- Use paginated reports for operational reports with tables of details and optional headers and footers.  \n",
    "- Additionally, you can use paginated reports when you expect to print the report on paper or when you want an e-receipt, a purchase order, or an invoice.  \n",

    "- The first step in creating a report is to get data from a data source.\n",
