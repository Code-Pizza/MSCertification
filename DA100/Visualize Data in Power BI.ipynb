    "# Choose an Effective Visualization  \n",
    "- Table: The table is a grid that contains related data in a logical series of rows and columns. The table supports two dimensions and it can also contain headers and a row for totals.\n",
    "- Matrix: Similar to the table visualization; however, it allows you to select one or more elements (rows, columns, values) in the matrix to cross-highlight other visuals on the report page.\n",
    "- Bar and Column Charts: Present specific data across different categories in a stacked or clustered format. \n",
    "- Line and area charts: Present trends over time.\n",
    "- Pie chart, donut chart, and Treemaps: Show the relationship of parts to the whole by dividing the data into segments. Good for visualizing data but not analyzing data.\n",
    "- A Treemap is ideal to visualize:\n",
    "    - Large amounts of hierarchical data when a bar chart can't effectively handle the large number of values.\n",
    "    - Proportions between each part and the whole.\n",
    "    - The distribution pattern of the measure across each level of categories in the hierarchy.\n",
    "    - Attributes, by using size and color coding.\n",
    "    - Spot patterns, outliers, most-important contributors, and exceptions.\n",
    "- Combo charts: A combination of a column chart and a line chart that can have one or two Y axes. The combination of the two charts into one lets you:\n",
    "    - Compare multiple measures with different value ranges.\n",
    "    - Illustrate the correlation between two measures in one visual.\n",
    "    - Identify whether one measure meets the target that is defined by another measure.\n",
    "    - Conserve space on your report page.\n",
    "- Card visualization: Displays a single value: a single data point. \n",
    "  - Ideal for visualizing important statistics that you want to track on your Power BI dashboard or report, such as total value, YTD sales, or year-over-year change.\n",
    "- Multi-row card visualization: Displays one or more data points, with one data point for each row.\n",
    "- Ideal for visualizing important statistics that you want to track on your Power BI dashboard or report, such as total value, YTD sales, or year-over-year change.\n",
    "- Funnel charts:\n",
    "  - When the data is sequential and moves through at least four stages.\n",
    "  - When the number of items in the first stage is expected to be greater than the number of items in the final stage.\n",
    "  - To calculate a potential outcome (revenue, sales, deals, and so on) by stages.\n",
    "  - To calculate and track conversion and retention rates.\n",
    "  - To reveal bottlenecks in a linear process.\n",
    "- Radial gauge chart: Has a circular arc and displays a single value that measures progress toward a goal or target.\n",
    "  - It is more effective to use a pair of gauges with a spark line so users can see the trend and know what to do about it.\n",
    "- Waterfall charts can be used to:\n",
    "  - Visualize changes over time or across different categories.\n",
    "  - Audit the major changes that contribute to the total value.\n",
    "  - Plot your organization's annual profit by showing various sources of revenue to help determine the total profit (or loss).\n",
    "  - Illustrate the beginning and ending headcount for your organization in a year.\n",
    "  - Visualize how much money you earn and spend each month and the running balance for your account.\n",
    "- Scatter charts also allow you to:\n",
    "  - Show relationships between two numerical values.\n",
    "  - Plot two groups of numbers as one series of x and y coordinates.\n",
    "  - Turn the horizontal axis into a logarithmic scale.\n",
    "  - Display worksheet data that includes pairs or grouped sets of values.\n",
    "  - Show patterns in large sets of data, for example, by showing linear or non-linear trends, clusters, and outliers.\n",
    "  - Compare large numbers of data points without regard to time. The more data that you include in a scatter chart, the better the comparisons that you can make.\n",
    "- Maps: Power BI integrates with Bing Maps to provide default map coordinates (a process called geocoding), so you can create maps.\n",
    "  - A basic map (bubble map) is used to associate categorical and quantitative information with spatial locations. This type of map visual displays precise geographical locations of data points on a map\n",
    "  - A fill map uses shading, tinting, or patterns to display how a value differs in proportion across a geographical region.\n",
    "  - Shape maps use colors to display relative comparisons of geographical regions.\n",
    "- Slicers are ideal to:\n",
    "  - Visualize commonly used or important filters on the report canvas for easier access.\n",
    "  - Simplify your ability to see the current filtered state without having to open a drop-down list.\n",
    "  - Filter by columns that are unneeded and hidden in the data tables.\n",
    "  - Create more focused reports by putting slicers next to important visuals.\n",
    "-  Q&A visualization consists of the following four core components:\n",
    "   -  The question box, where users enter their question and are shown suggestions to help them complete the question.\n",
    "   -  A pre-populated list of suggested questions.\n",
    "   -  An icon that users can select to convert the Q&A visual into a standard visual.\n",
    "   -  An icon that users can select to open Q&A tooling, which allows designers to configure the underlying natural language engine."
