    "# Good Data Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "**A good data model offers the following benefits:**\n",
    "1. Data exploration is faster.\n",
    "1. Aggregations are simpler to build.\n",
    "1. Reports are more accurate.\n",
    "1. Writing reports takes less time.\n",
    "1. Reports are easier to maintain in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "Aim for simplicity when designing your data models.\n",
    "Relationships are defined between tables through primary and foreign keys. Primary keys are column(s) that identify each unique, non-null data row.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Star schemas\n",
    "Design a star schema to simplify your data. \n",
    "In a star schema, each table within your dataset is defined as a dimension or a fact table\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fact Tables**\n",
    "1. Fact tables contain observational or event data values\n",
    "1. Fact tables can contain several repeated values.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dimension Tables**\n",
    "1. Dimension tables contain the details about the data in fact tables\n",
    "1. Dimension tables contain unique values\n",
    "\n",
    "Fact tables are usually much larger than dimension tables because numerous events occur in fact tables  \n",
    "Star schemas and the underlying data model are the foundation of organized reports\n",
    "\n",
    "# Work with tables\n",
    "\n",
    "**A simple table structure will:**\n",
    "1. Be simple to navigate because of column and table properties that are specific and user-friendly\n",
    "1. Have merged or appended tables to simplify the tables within your data structure\n",
    "1. Have good-quality relationships between tables that make sense\n",
    "\n",
    "## Configure data model and build relationships between tables\n",
    "\n",
    "1. To manage these relationships, go to Manage Relationships on the ribbon\n",
    "1. The Autodetect feature will help you establish relationships between columns that are named similarly\n",
    "1. Relationships can be inactive or active\n",
    "\n",
    "## Configure table and column properties\n",
    "\n",
    "**Under the General tab, you can:**\n",
    "1. Edit the name and description of the column\n",
    "1. Add synonyms that can be used to identify the column when you are using the Q&A feature\n",
    "1. Add a column into a folder to further organize the table structure\n",
    "1. Hide or show the column\n",
    "\n",
    "**Under the Formatting tab, you can:**\n",
    "1. Change the data type\n",
    "1. Format the date.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Under the Advanced tab, you can:**\n",
    "1. Sort by a specific column\n",
    "1. Assign a specific category to the data\n",
    "1. Summarize the data\n",
    "1. Determine if the column or table contains null values\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a date table\n",
    "Organizations want to know how their business is doing over months, quarters, fiscal years, and so on. For this reason, it is crucial that these time-oriented values are formatted correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Create a common date table\n",
    "**Ways that you can build a common date table are:**\n",
    "1. Source data\n",
    "1. DAX\n",
    "1. Power Query\n",
    "\n",
    "**Source Data Tables**\n",
    "Source data tables are mature and ready for immediate use. If you have a table as such, bring it into your data model and don't use any other methods that are outlined in this section. We recommend that you use a source date table because it is likely shared with other tools that you might be using in addition to Power BI.\n",
    "\n",
    "**DAX**\n",
    "1. CALENDAR() function returns a contiguous range of dates based on a start and end date that are entered as arguments in the function\n",
    "1. CALENDARAUTO() function returns a contiguous, complete range of dates that are automatically determined from your dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "- Go to the Table tab on the ribbon\n",
    "- Select New Table\n",
    "- Enter in the following DAX formula:  \n",
    "`Dates  = CALENDAR(DATE(2011, 5, 31), DATE(2022, 12, 31))`\n",
    "- Add the Detail columns  \n",
    "`Year = YEAR(Dates[Date])`  \n",
    "`MonthNum = MONTH(Dates[Date])`  \n",
    "`WeekNum = WEEKNUM(Dates[Date])`  \n",
    "`DayoftheWeek = FORMAT(Dates[Date], \"DDDD\")`  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Power Query**\n",
    "1. New Query --> Blank Query\n",
    "`= List.Dates(#date(2011,05,31), 365*10, #duration(1,0,0,0))`\n",
    "1. Then convert to a table from the list with  \n",
    "`Transform tab on the ribbon and select Convert > To Table`\n",
    "1. Ensure column is set to date type\n",
    "1. Go to Add Column --> Date --> Year\n",
    "    a. Complete the same process for months, weeks, and days\n",
    "\n",
    "## Mark as the Official Date Table\n",
    "1. Right-click the name of the table and then select Mark as date table  \n",
    "1. By marking your table as a date table, Power BI performs validations to ensure that the data contains zero null values, is unique, and contains continuous date values over a period. \n",
    "1. Select Date table settings to choose which column should be marked as Date.\n",
    "1. Selecting Mark as date table will remove autogenerated hierarchies from the Date field in the table that you marked as a date table.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Build your visual\n",
    "1. Ensure relationships are defined\n",
    "1. Create a measure to display\n",
    "`#Total Sales = SUM(Sales[‘Amount’])`\n",
    "1. Go the Visualizations tab and selecting the visual\n",
    "    a. Select data to include in the visual\n",
    "\n",
    "# Work with dimensions\n",
    "Dimension tables store details about business entitie\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hierarchies\n",
    "When you are building visuals, Power BI automatically enters values of the date type as a hierarchy (if the table has not been marked as a date table).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Hierarchies allow you to view increasing levels of data on a single view.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Parent-child hierarchy\n",
    "e.g. Managers (parent) and Employees (child)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Flatten parent-child hierarchy\n",
    "The process of viewing multiple child levels based on a top-level parent is known as flattening the hierarchy. In this process, you are creating multiple columns in a table to show the hierarchical path of the parent to the child in the same record  \n",
    "1. Use PATH() to return a text version of the path for each child  \n",
    "1. Use PATHITEM() to separate this path into each level of the hierarchy.\n",
    "1. Create a new column on table with parent-child hierarchy\n",
    "`Path = PATH(Table[ChildID], Table[ParentID])`\n",
    "1. To view all levels of the hierarchy separately create four columns\n",
    "`Level 1 = PATHITEM(Table[Path],1)`\n",
    "`Level 2 = PATHITEM(Table[Path],2)`\n",
    "`Level 3 = PATHITEM(Table[Path],3)`\n",
    "1. Create a hierarchy on the Fields pane\n",
    "    a. Right-click Level 1, because this is the first hierarchy level\n",
    "    b. Select New Hierarchy\n",
    "    c. Drag and drop Level 2 and Level 3 into this hierarchy\n",
    "\n",
    "# Role-playing dimensions\n",
    "1. Role-playing dimensions have multiple valid relationships with fact tables\n",
    "1. The same dimension can be used to filter multiple columns or tables of data\n",
    "\n",
    "# Define data granularity\n"
