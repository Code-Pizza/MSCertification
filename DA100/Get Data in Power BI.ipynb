    "# Get Data in Power BI\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "- Data resides in several different databases and files\n",
    "  - Data repositories are different from each other\n",
    "  - But all the data is related.\n",
    "## By the end of this module:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Identify and connect to a data source\n",
    "- Get data from a relational database, such as Microsoft SQL Server\n",
    "- Get data from a file, such as Microsoft Excel\n",
    "- Get data from applications\n",
    "- Get data from Azure Analysis Services\n",
    "- Select a storage mode\n",
    "- Fix performance issues\n",
    "- Resolve data import errors\n",
    "\n",
    "## Get data from files\n",
    "- One possible file format is a flat file\n",
    "  - A flat file is a type of file that has only one data table and every row of data is in the same structure\n",
    "  - The file does not contain hierarchies\n",
    "    - Comma-separated values (.csv) files\n",
    "    - Delimited text (.txt) files\n",
    "    - Fixed width files\n",
    "    - .xlsx\n",
    "\n",
    "### Flat file location\n",
    "- The first step is to determine which file location that you want to use to export and store your data.\n",
    "  - Local - import data from a local file into Power BI\n",
    "    - The file isn't moved into Power BI, a new dataset is created in Power BI\n",
    "    - Changes to the original file are not reflected in your Power BI dataset\n",
    "    - Use local data import for data that doesn't change.\n",
    "  - OneDrive for Business\n",
    "    - Power BI connects regularly to your file on OneDrive and automatically updates Power BI\n",
    "  - OneDrive - Personal\n",
    "    - Need to sign in with your personal OneDrive account, and select the Keep me signed in option\n",
    "  - SharePoint - Team Sites \n",
    "\n",
    "Home tab contains quick access data source options, such as Excel, next to the Get data button.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Select the file data to import\n",
    "- Navigator window shows the data that is available in the data source\n",
    "  - Select a table or entity to preview its contents, to ensure that the correct data is loaded into the Power BI model\n",
    "- Select the check box(es) of the table(s) that you want to bring in to Power BI\n",
    "  - Activates the Load and Transform Data buttons\n",
    "  - Select the Load button to automatically load your data into the Power BI model\n",
    "  - Select the Transform Data button to launch the Power Query Editor\n",
    "    - Review and clean your data before loading it into the Power BI model\n",
    "\n",
    "### Change the source file\n",
    "- To change the location of a source file for a data source:\n",
    "  - Data source settings\n",
    "  - Query settings\n",
    "  - Advanced Editor \n",
    "Warning: When changing a file path ensure that you reconnect to the same file with the same file structure- structural changes in the source file, will break the reporting model\n",
    "\n",
    "## Get Data from Relational Data Sources\n",
    "- Use Power BI Desktop to establish a connection to your organization's relational database\n",
    "- Connecting Power BI to your database will help you to monitor the progress of your business and identify trends, so you can forecast sales figures, plan budgets and set performance indicators and targets\n",
    "\n",
    "### Connect to data in a relational database\n",
    "- Use the Get data feature in Power BI Desktop \n",
    "  - Select the applicable option for your relational database\n",
    "    - Enter your database server name and a database name in the SQL Server database \n",
    "    - Select data connectivity mode: Import (selected by default, recommended) and DirectQuery\n",
    "    - Prompted to sign in with a username and password with three sign-in options:\n",
    "      - Windows - Use your Windows account (Azure Active Directory credentials)\n",
    "      - Database - Use your database credentials\n",
    "      - Microsoft account - Use your Microsoft account credentials\n",
    "\n",
    "### Select data to import\n",
    "- The Navigator window displays the data that is available in your data source (the SQL database in this example)\n",
    "  - Select a table or entity to preview its contents and make sure that the correct data will be loaded into the Power BI model\n",
    "    - Select the check box(es) of the table(s) that you want\n",
    "    - Select either the Load or Transform Data option.\n",
    "      - Load - Automatically load your data into a Power BI model in its current state.\n",
    "      - Transform Data - Open your data in Microsoft Power Query\n",
    "\n",
    "### Import data by writing an SQL query  \n",
    "- In the SQL Server database window\n",
    "  - Enter your server and database names, \n",
    "  - Select the arrow next to Advanced options\n",
    "    - Enter the query statement, and then select OK. In this example, you will use the Select SQL statement to load the ID, NAME and SALESAMOUNT columns from the SALES table.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Change data source settings  \n",
    "- Return and change your connection settings at any time\n",
    "  - Select Transform data\n",
    "  - Select the Data source settings option.\n",
    "  - Select the data source that you want to update\n",
    "  - Use the update options \n",
    "\n",
    "### Write an SQL statement\n",
    "Consider writing a query like in a view. A view is an object in a relational database, similar to a table. Views have rows and columns, and can contain almost every operator in the SQL language. If Power BI uses a view, when it retrieves data, it participates in query folding, a feature of Power Query. Query folding will be explained later, but in short, Power Query will optimize data retrieval according to how the data is being used later.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Get Data from a NoSQL database\n",
    "A NoSQL database (also referred to as non-SQL, not only SQL or non-relational) is a flexible type of database that does not use tables to store data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Connect to a NoSQL database (Azure Cosmos DB)\n",
    "- Use the Get data\n",
    "  - Select the More... option to locate and connect to the type of database\n",
    "  - Enter your database credentials\n",
    "\n",
    "### Import a JSON file\n",
    "- JSON type records must be extracted and normalized before you can report on them, so you need to transform the data before loading it into Power BI Desktop.\n",
    "- In Power Query, select the Expander button to the right side of the Column1 header\n",
    "  - Select the fields that you want to load into Power BI Desktop\n",
    "\n",
    "## Get Data from Online Services\n",
    "- A range of software applications, such as SharePoint, OneDrive, Dynamics 365, Google Analytics \n",
    "\n",
    "### Connect to data in an application\n",
    "- Select the Get data feature in Power BI Desktop\n",
    "  - Selectthe option that you need from the Online Services category\n",
    "\n",
    "### Choose the application data to import\n",
    "- Select the list that you want to load into Power BI Desktop\n",
    "- Load or launch the Power Query Editor to transform your data before loading it\n",
    "\n",
    "## Select a Storage Mode\n",
    "- There may be security requirements or other constraints around your data that make it impossible to directly import a copy\n",
    "  - Use the DirectQuery storage mode to query the data in the data source directly \n",
    "  - Does not import a copy into Power BI\n",
    "  - Ensures you are always viewing the most recent version of the data\n",
    "\n",
    "### Three Storage Modes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Import mode\n",
    "  - The Import mode allows you to create a local Power BI copy of your datasets from your data source\n",
    "  - Data refreshes can be scheduled or on-demand\n",
    "  - The default mode when creating new Power BI reports\n",
    "- DirectQuery mode\n",
    "  - Does not save local copies of data because so the data will not be cached\n",
    "  - Suited for when you have large datasets to pull data from. \n",
    "    - Use DirectQuery to create a connection to the source, solving data latency issues\n",
    "- Dual (Composite mode)\n",
    "- Identify some data to be directly imported \n",
    "- And other data that must be queried\n",
    "\n",
    "## Get data from Azure Analysis Services\n",
    "- Azure Analysis Services is an Azure product that allows you to ingest data from multiple data sources, build relationships between the data, and creates calculations on the data. \n",
    "- The calculations are built using data analysis expressions (DAX)\n",
    "- Connect live is a new option in Azure Analysis Services. \n",
    "- Azure Analysis Services uses the tabular model and DAX to build calculations\n",
    "- Similar to a relational database, you can choose the tables that you want to use\n",
    "\n",
    "## Fix performance issues\n",
    "- Power BI provides the Performance Analyzer tool to help fix problems and streamline the process\n",
    "  \n",
    "### Optimize performance in Power Query\n",
    "- The performance in Power Query depends on the performance at the data source level. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Query folding\n",
    "- The process by which the transformations and edits that you make in Power Query Editor are simultaneously tracked as native queries, or simple Select SQL statements\n",
    "- Benefits to query folding include:\n",
    "  - More efficiency in data refreshes and incremental refreshes\n",
    "  - Automatic compatibility with DirectQuery and Dual storage modes\n",
    "- Native queries are not possible for the following transformations:\n",
    "  - Adding an index column\n",
    "  - Merging and appending columns of different tables with two different sources\n",
    "  - Changing the data type of a column\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Query diagnostics\n",
    "- Allows you to determine what bottlenecks (if any) exist while:\n",
    "  - Loading and transforming your data\n",
    "  - Refreshing your data in Power Query\n",
    "  - Running SQL statements in Query Editor, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Other techniques to optimize performance  \n",
    "- Process as much data as possible in the original data source\n",
    "- Use native SQL queries. When using DirectQuery for SQL databases\n",
    "- Separate date and time, if bound together\n",
    "\n",
    "## Resolve data import errors\n",
    "- Power BI imports from numerous data sources.\n",
    "- Each data source might have dozens (and sometimes hundreds) of different error messages.\n",
    "- Other components can cause errors, such as hard drives, networks, software services, and operating systems.\n",
    "- Data can often not comply with any specific schema.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Query timeout expired\n",
    "- Some relational systems limit users from monopolizing all hardware resources by setting a query timeout\n",
    "\n",
    "### Power BI Query Error: Timeout expired\n",
    "- This error indicates that you’ve pulled too much data according to your organization’s policies. Administrators incorporate this policy to avoid slowing down a different application or suite of applications that might also be using that database.\n",
    "- Resolve this error by pulling fewer columns or rows from a single table\n",
    "\n",
    "### We couldn't find any data formatted as a table\n",
    "- This error is self-explanatory. Power BI expects to find data formatted as a table from Excel\n",
    "- Resolve by formatting the data as a table in Excel\n",
    "\n",
    "### Could not find file\n",
    "- Change the file location to the new location.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Data type errors\n",
    "- Sometimes, when you import data into Power BI, the columns appear blank\n",
    "- Resolution to this error is unique to the data source\n",
    "  - By specifying the correct type at the data source, you eliminate many of these common data source errors\n"
