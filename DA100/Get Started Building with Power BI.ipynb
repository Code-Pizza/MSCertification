    "# Get Started Building With Power BI\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "- Microsoft Power BI is a collection of software services, apps, and connectors that work together to turn your unrelated sources of data into coherent, visually immersive, and interactive insights\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Parts of Power BI\n",
    "- Power BI consists of:\n",
    "  - A Microsoft Windows desktop application called Power BI Desktop\n",
    "  - An online SaaS (Software as a Service) service called the Power BI service\n",
    "  - A mobile Power BI app that are available on any device:\n",
    "    - Windows\n",
    "    - iOS\n",
    "    - Android\n",
    "- Designed to let people create, share, and consume business insights in the way that serves them, or their role, most effectively\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Power BI matches your role\n",
    "- How you use Power BI might depend on your role on a project or a team. And other people, in other roles, might use Power BI differently, which is just fine\n",
    "\n",
    "### Download Power BI Desktop\n",
    "- From the Windows Store: https://aka.ms/pbidesktopstore\n",
    "\n",
    "### From the Flow of Work in Power BI\n",
    "- A common flow of work in Power BI begins in Power BI Desktop\n",
    "  - A report is created\n",
    "  - That report is then published to the Power BI service\n",
    "  - Finally the report is shared\n",
    "\n",
    "## Use Power BI\n",
    "  The common flow of activity looks like this:\n",
    "  1. Bring data into Power BI Desktop, and create a report.\n",
    "  2.  Publish to the Power BI service, where you can create new visualizations or build dashboards.\n",
    "  3.  Share dashboards with others, especially people who are on the go.\n",
    "  4.  View and interact with shared dashboards and reports in Power BI Mobile apps.\n",
    "  5.  Power BI cycle of use\n",
    "\n",
    "## Building Blocks of Power BI\n",
    "Everything you do in Microsoft Power BI can be broken down into a few basic building blocks. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the basic building blocks in Power BI:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Visualizations\n",
    "- A visualization (sometimes also referred to as a visual) is a visual representation of data\n",
    "  - Chart\n",
    "  - Color-coded map\n",
    "- Visualizations can be simple\n",
    "  - A single number that represents something significant\n",
    "- Visulizations can be visually complex\n",
    "  - A gradient-colored map that shows voter sentiment about a certain social issue or concern\n",
    "- The goal of a visual is to present data in a way that provides context and insights\n",
    "\n",
    "### Datasets\n",
    "- A dataset is a collection of data that Power BI uses to create its visualizations.\n",
    "- Can be simple dataset that's based on a single table from a Microsoft Excel workbook\n",
    "- Or Datasets can also be a combination of many different sources\n",
    "- Filtering data before bringing it into Power BI lets you focus on the data that matters to you\n",
    "- Power BI contains a multitude of data connectors that let you easily connect to that data, filter it if necessary, and bring it into your dataset\n",
    "  \n",
    "### Reports\n",
    "- A report is a collection of visualizations that appear together on one or more pages\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dashboards\n",
    "- When you're ready to share a report, or a collection of visualizations, you create a dashboard\n",
    "- A Power BI dashboard is a collection of visuals from a single page that you can share with others\n",
    "  - A selected group of visuals that provide quick insight into the data or story you're trying to present\n",
    "- A dashboard must fit on a single page, often called a canvas\n",
    "  \n",
    "### Tiles\n",
    "- A tile is a single visualization on a dashboard\n",
    "- The rectangular box that holds an individual visual\n",
    "- When you're creating a dashboard in Power BI, you can move or arrange tiles however you want. You can make them bigger, change their height or width, and snuggle them up to other tiles\n",
    "- When you're viewing, or consuming, a dashboard or report—which means you're not the creator or owner, but the report or dashboard has been shared with you—you can interact with it, but you can't change the size of the tiles or their arrangement\n",
    "\n",
    "## All together now\n",
    "Power BI is a collection of services, apps, and connectors that lets you connect to your data, wherever it happens to reside, filter it if necessary, and then bring it into Power BI to create compelling visualizations that you can share with others.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tour and Use the Power BI Service\n",
    "- The common flow of work in Microsoft Power BI\n",
    "  - Create a report in Power BI Desktop\n",
    "  - Publish it to the Power BI service\n",
    "  - Share it with others\n",
    "- An easy and popular way to quickly create visuals in Power BI: apps\n",
    "  - An app is a collection of preset, ready-made visuals and reports that are shared with an entire organization\n",
    "- Create out-of-box dashboards with cloud services\n",
    "- From the Power BI service, you can just select the Get Data button in the lower-left corner of the home page\n",
    "  - The canvas (the area in the center of the Power BI service) shows you the available sources of data in the Power BI service\n",
    "  - In addition to common data sources like Microsoft Excel files, databases, or Microsoft Azure data, Power BI can just as easily connect to a whole assortment of software services (also called SaaS providers or cloud services): Salesforce, Facebook, Google Analytics, and more\n",
    "  - For these software services, the Power BI service provides a collection of ready-made visuals that are pre-arranged on dashboards and reports for your organization. \n",
    "  - This collection of visuals is called an app installation of the app begins.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Update data in the Power BI service\n",
    "- To set update settings, select the schedule update icon for the dataset to update\n",
    "- Select the update icon (the circle with an arrow) next to the schedule update icon to update the dataset immediately\n",
    "  - The Datasets tab is selected on the Settings page that appears\n",
    "  - In the right pane, select the arrow next to Scheduled refresh to expand that section.\n",
    "  - The Settings dialog box appears on the canvas, letting you set the update settings that meet your needs\n",
    "  \n",
    "  ## Summary\n",
    "  - Microsoft Power BI is a collection of software services, apps, and connectors that work together to turn your data into interactive insights\n",
    "  - Use data from single basic sources or pull in data from multiple databases and cloud sources to create complex datasets and reports\n",
    "  - Power BI consists of three main elements:\n",
    "    - Power BI Desktop\n",
    "    - The Power BI service\n",
    "    - Power BI Mobile\n",
    "  - The basic building blocks in Power BI:\n",
    "    - Visualizations – A visual representation of data, sometimes just called visuals\n",

    "    - Reports – A collection of visuals from a dataset, spanning one or more pages\n",
    "    - Dashboards – A single-page collection of visuals built from a report\n",
    "    - Tiles – A single visualization on a report or dashboard\n",
    "  - App: a ready-made collection of visuals and reports\n",
    "  - Set up a refresh schedule for our data\n",
